    "### 1. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Protests are significant socio-political events that can shape the trajectory of nations and influence global dynamics. Understanding the dynamics of protests, including their causes, demands, and state responses, is critical for policymakers, researchers, and international organizations. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of protests in driving political change and social movements. For instance, Tilly (2004) highlights how protests have historically served as a mechanism for marginalized groups to voice their demands and effect change. Additionally, studies by Beissinger (2002) and Chenoweth and Stephan (2011) have shown the impact of mass mobilizations on political outcomes and the conditions under which nonviolent protests are more likely to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the contemporary world, the need to understand protest dynamics remains as crucial as ever. The global landscape is marked by significant political, economic, and social upheavals. Protests continue to play a pivotal role in challenging injustices, advocating for rights, and prompting governmental reforms. The Arab Spring, the Black Lives Matter movement, and recent protests in response to economic policies and climate change are testament to the enduring power and relevance of collective action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing modern protest data can provide invaluable insights into current socio-political climates, helping to forecast potential unrest, understand public sentiment, and guide policy responses. By studying this dataset, which spans protests worldwide from 1990 onwards, we aim to uncover patterns and trends in protests, identify the key issues being protested, and understand how governments typically respond to such events.\n"

    "### 2.BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "Understanding the dynamics of protests, including their causes, demands, and state responses, is critical for policymakers, researchers, and international organizations. This project aims to analyze protest events globally from 1990 to March 2020, focusing on identifying underlying factors, geographical distribution, and temporal trends. By leveraging NLP techniques, it will uncover common themes in protester demands and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of various state responses. The insights gained will inform actionable policy recommendations, enhance the understanding of social movements, and improve strategies for managing social unrest. Key success metrics include accurately identifying protest trends, categorizing demands, evaluating state responses, and achieving high accuracy in sentiment analysis and topic relevance."
